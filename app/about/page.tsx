      <p className="text-xl mb-6">
        Blockchain Miner is an interactive game that simulates blockchain
        mining. Players start with a basic mining power and can upgrade tools,
        increase mining power, and automatically mine tokens. The goal is to
        collect tokens and improve your mining operation by purchasing better
        tools and upgrades.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How the Game Works</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Players click to mine tokens and accumulate balance. The more you mine,
        the more you can invest in upgrading your mining power and purchasing
        advanced mining tools. You can also buy an auto miner to help you mine
        tokens automatically. Achieve milestones and upgrade your mining
        efficiency to dominate the blockchain mining world.
